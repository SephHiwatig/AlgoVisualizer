    <h1>Dijkstra's Shortest Path</h1>
    <p>
      Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF
      algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in
      a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived
      by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years
      later.
